// This are what called 'loan' functions. They are used to assign values to variables using something similar to a one-liner.
let a: Int = from (
	let b: Int = 1
) take b

// That above is equivalent to:
// let b: Int = 1
// let a: Int = b
// Functions inside loan nodes are automatically using the 'at' notation (see 'at' notatio in the documentation).
